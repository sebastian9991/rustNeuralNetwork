# Neural Network and Evolutionary Algorithm from Scratch in RUST!

## Beginning of the world:

Notice the bird's performance, on average, to find and find as much food is not great. (Look at the spinning cases)

## Near end of the world:

Each bird in this population has a much greater performance in locating food! Finding the food at a much greater pace and with more direction!
